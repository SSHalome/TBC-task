This is TBC-task

Used Nging HA for two EC2 Active-Passive configuration using one Elastic IP address. Used nginx-ha-check and nginx-ha-notify scripts alongside with Keepalived.conf for completing that task.
You will also find userdata script for installing nginx on ec2 instances and the index.html I used.
